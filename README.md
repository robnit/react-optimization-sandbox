##Pixel optimization sandbox##

A supplimental repo I threw together to play with while doing a React performance deep dive. No utilitarian purpose other than to be a fun aethetic toy and to be very resource intensive.

It seems to still be relatively nonperformant at high volumes, despite nearly every optimiation trick I could throw at it. If there is a solution to making this work without making the computer smell like burning plastic, I hope to find it.

###To Use:###
- Clone
- Run `npm i` or `yarn`
- Run `npm start` or `yarn start`
- Navigate to localhost:8080
- Move your mouse cursor around the center of the screen really fast
- Observe the pretty but increasingly slow pixel aesthetic
